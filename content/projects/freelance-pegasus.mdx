# Case Summary

Back in 2020, my dad was tired of using google sheets to do his horse race
prediction calculations. So I offered to build him a program that does this for him.

I built him a windows desktop application with a graphic user interface for him to provide
the necessary input for each participating horse, and then, with a click of a button, be able
to see the prediction calculations. This helps his clients have a somewhat better chance of
choosing the right horse before each race.

Then I built him a Gatsy website, and deployed it to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). To help
him showcase his business offerings.

# My Take

I found it an interesting opportunity to explore the python language while getting a
glimpse into how horse prediction calculations are made.

I used the [Kivy framework](https://kivy.org/), and had fun learning a new non-web apporach to
building graphical user interfaces.
