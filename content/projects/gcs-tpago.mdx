# Case Summary

The Dominican Republic and Guatemala lacked the financial tools to enable mobile payments, which would
save a lot of time when compared to traditional trips to the bank for making payments and transfers.

In the face of this, [GCS International](https://gcs-international.com/) developed a payments platform that allowed people and businesses
to make these financial transactions from the convenience of their mobile phone screens.

They made the capabilities of this platform available through a USSD interface to reach those people
without a smartphone, as well as through the tPago mobile app for people with access to
the Android and iOS operating systems.

The financial infrastructure that GCS International built has made financial transactions easier
for hundreds of local businesses and hundreds of thousands of poeple across the Dominican Republic
and Guatemala.

# My Take

I am very grateful for having the opportunity to learn how financial systems work, and what
the financial infrastructure for The Dominican Republic and Guatemala looks like under the hood.

I was part of the skilled backend team responsible for developing and maintaining all the
services required to enable the USSD interface, the tPago mobile app, the company's internal
financial operations, and the payment processing logic that sent transactions through the
electronic banking network.

Today I can say that this was my first true exposure to what is possible when softare
aims to solve the right problems. Something that I will forever value greatly.
