# Case Summary

Back when I worked as a fraud monitoring offier at Scotiabank, I had a colleague
that ran a car re-selling side-hustle during his free time. Once he saw that I built
the knowledge center being used by people in the department. He asked me for help
in automating part of his lead acquisition process.

Since I was just learning about software development, I thought it would be a nice
challange to embark on. So I decided to help him for a small price equivalent to 67
dollars for the full project. I had never been paid before for developing something,
so I was excited to be in business.

I developed a python script that used a Selenium client to get the online marketplace's
page, apply the necessary filters, and automatically scrape relevant offer info, and
seller contact details. This would then be written to a csv file that my colleague would
later use to prioritize his sales calls throughout the day. The script was distributed
to him as a windows .bat file that he could just double click from his computer's desktop.

Previously, manually scraping the offers would take him a couple hours. Thanks to the scraper,
he only spends about 3-5 minutes before he is ready to start calling his leads.

# My Take

This project allowed me to sell my first program. Though it was a small amount and it was
just a single sale, it marks a shift in mindset to materialized the value of what software
engineers, can do.
