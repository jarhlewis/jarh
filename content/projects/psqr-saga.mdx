# Case Summary

Companies around the world must meet regulations that monitor where their products come from,
how they manufacture them, where they deliver them, among other things.

In the face of this, PSQR built the Saga platform. It allows companies to meet these regulations
by tracking the relevant business operations and logistics using the [GS1 EPCIS standard](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis).
Allowing regulators to trace the full journey of any product made.

As Saga grew rich in functionality, it became possible to tackle more complex challenges such as
[STYR](/projects/psqr-styr) for instance. In some cases, even allowing customers to 
extend the functionality themselves through the available SDK in the Enterprise version.

Today Saga helps companies beyond compliance, as it tackles observability, automation,
and traceability challenges ever more gracefully and powerfully.

# My Take

I am currently part of the skilled team of engineers that further develops Saga into new projects.
Advancing Saga as a product, and solving the unique challenges that our clients face.

Throughout this journey I have been able to learn a great deal about software engineering. Projects span
very different kinds of businesses at very different scales, which has made me very DevOps aware.

On the other hand, working with clients as well as partners has allowed me to develop UIs for clients,
APIs for integrations, and SDKs for fellow developers. The latter has been specially helpful in improving
my ability to produce clean code structures and architectures that maximize readability, discoverability,
and reusability, beyond meeting the presented requirements and constraints of the challenge at hand.
